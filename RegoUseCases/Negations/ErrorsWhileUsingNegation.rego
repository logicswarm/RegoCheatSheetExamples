package Negations.ErrorsWhileUsingNegation

# Rego is existentially quantified.
# This means that rule bodies and queries express FOR ANY and not FOR ALL.
# Thus, while usingÂ != it looks for a single value which is not equal to the value compared.
# However when we use negations we often need to compare FOR ALL rather than FOR ANY.

# rule will throw an error if a variable appearing in a negated expression doesnt   appear in another non-negated equality expression in the rule
