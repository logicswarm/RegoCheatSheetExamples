#Rego is existentially quantified.
#This means that rule bodies and queries express FOR ANY and not FOR ALL.
#Thus, while usingÂ != it looks for a single value which is not equal to the value compared,
#however when we use negations we often need to compare FOR ALL rather than FOR ANY.

#Another rule that's enforced by OPA is that ,
#a variable appearing in a negated expression must also appear in another non-negated equality expression in the rule ,
#else it will throw an error.
